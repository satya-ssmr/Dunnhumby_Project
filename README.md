# **Dunnhumby Retail Data Analytics Project:**

### **Overview:**

I am working on a data analysis project involving comprehensive datasets from Tesco, one of the UK's largest retail chains
Dunnhumby is Tesco's Media and insight platform, famous for helping tesco establish Clubcard. 
I am working with eight large datasets, some featuring over 2 million rows, to uncover insights into Tesco's operations and customer behavior.

### **Project Scope:**


###### **Data Exploration:** 
Conducting a thorough exploratory analysis to understand trends, patterns, and anomalies within the datasets.

###### **Customer Behavior Analysis:** 
Analyzing customer demographics and transaction data to uncover buying patterns and preferences.

###### **Product Performance:** 
Assessing the performance of different product categories and identifying factors contributing to their success or underperformance.

###### Campaign Effectiveness: 
Evaluating the impact of marketing campaigns and promotions on sales and customer engagement.

###### Advanced Predictive Analysis:

In later stages, using advanced statistical methods and machine learning models to predict trends and customer behavior.



### **The datasets include:**

_transaction_data.csv:_  Detailed records of customer transactions.

_demographics.csv:_ Data on customer demographics.

_products.csv:_ Information on Tesco's product range.

_campaign_data.csv:_ Insights into marketing campaigns.

_coupon.csv:_ Data on coupon issuance.

_coupon_redemption.csv:_ Records of coupon redemptions.

_causal_data.csv:_ Data for causal inference analysis.

These datasets collectively offer a holistic view of Tesco's retail landscape.

### **Current Stage: SQL and Power BI for EDA**

Currently, I am conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL for data querying and Power BI for visualization. 
This combination allows for efficient handling of large datasets and the creation of interactive, insightful visualizations.

### **Future Plans: Python for Advanced Analysis**

In the subsequent phases, I will use Python for more complex exploratory analysis. 
The choice of Python, particularly the Pandas library, is due to its powerful data manipulation capabilities, which are essential for handling and analyzing large datasets. 
Matplotlib will be used for its versatility in creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
This approach is aimed at extracting deeper insights and facilitating more advanced data exploration.

### **Collaboration and Feedback**
I am open to collaboration and value feedback. If you have insights, suggestions, or relevant expertise, please feel free to contribute or reach out.
