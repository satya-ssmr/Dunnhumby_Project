# **Dunnhumby Retail Data Analytics Project:**

My Story behind choosing this project (dataset)

### **Overview:**

    I am working on a data analysis project involving comprehensive datasets from Tesco, one of the UK's largest 
    retail chains. Dunnhumby is Tesco's Media and insight platform, famous for helping tesco establish Clubcard. 
    I am working with eight large datasets, some featuring over 2 million rows, to uncover insights into Tesco's 
    operations and customer behavior.

## For Dashboards
    Look for .pbix files in every repository. (sql has been used for data retrival)
    Look

## For My thought process
    Look for the file names that start with 'T'
    T.Datacleaning_Preprocessing.ipynb

## For the notebook
    Datacleaning_Preprocessing.ipynb

## Notebook Breakdown, for data analysis skills
    I have divided the Project into 3 parts. 
    Part 1: Data cleaning and Data pre-processing; Since there are 2M+ rows in the 8 datasets it has got, There are many
            missing values. I need to handle the missing values in an appropriate way and ready the data for the EDA.
    
    Part 2: The initial exploratory analysis will be performed on all the datasets 
            one by one and then merging datasets together and uncovering the relations among multiple variables.
               
             Jupyter Notebook: transaction_data_analysis.ipynb

    Part 3: Perform predictive analytics to understand the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns based on the 
            coupon usage and other variables, evaluate model and generate forecast 
            


## **Project Scope:**


###### **Data Exploration:** 
Conducting a thorough exploratory analysis to understand trends, patterns, and anomalies within the datasets.

###### **Customer Behavior Analysis:** 
Analyzing customer demographics and transaction data to uncover buying patterns and preferences.

###### **Product Performance:** 
Assessing the performance of different product categories and identifying factors contributing to their success or underperformance.

###### Campaign Effectiveness: 
Evaluating the impact of marketing campaigns and promotions on sales and customer engagement.

###### Advanced Predictive Analysis:

In later stages, using advanced statistical methods and machine learning models to predict trends and customer behavior.



### **The datasets include:**

_transaction_data.csv:_  Detailed records of customer transactions.

_demographics.csv:_ Data on customer demographics.

_products.csv:_ Information on Tesco's product range.

_campaign_data.csv:_ Insights into marketing campaigns.

_coupon.csv:_ Data on coupon issuance.

_coupon_redemption.csv:_ Records of coupon redemptions.

_causal_data.csv:_ Data for causal inference analysis.

These datasets collectively offer a holistic view of Tesco's retail landscape.

### **Current Stage: SQL and Jupyter Notebooks for EDA**

Currently, I am using SQL for data querying and Jupyter Notebook for 
exploratory data analysis. This combination allows for efficient handling of large datasets and the creation of 
interactive, insightful visualizations.

### **Future Plans: scikit for Advanced Analysis**

In the subsequent phases, I will use Python for more complex exploratory analysis. 
The choice of Python, particularly the Pandas library, is due to its powerful data manipulation capabilities, which are essential for handling and analyzing large datasets. 
Matplotlib will be used for its versatility in creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
This approach is aimed at extracting deeper insights and facilitating more advanced data exploration.

### **Collaboration and Feedback**
Collaborations and feedback are welcome, especially from those with expertise in retail data analysis or Python-based data science techniques.
